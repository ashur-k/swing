notes & defs:

Shot Track -- Edit
Camera Cut Track - Per Shot

Remember Autokey

- Avoid motion blur when blocking
- Skeletons should have 1 root bone

- Asset Action/ Select Skeleton / 

- Unreal will automatically convert quads to triads
- keep to scale
- deformers don't work -- maya to Unreal
    - cache geo to alembic, add to joint based fbx Skeleton

- flatten tracks on alembic cache import if loads of textures

- can't tune alembic within Unreal

--alembic imports +++++ spawnable, heavy
-- pathing tends to feel artificial
-- scenery, shots, sequences -- Unreal
-- art department --> unreal
-- we don't want to be animating in unreal

shot <--> level sequence (unreal)

shot creation vs shot editing
-- sort by file system directory name
-- each shot is a level sequence
-- Cinematics/sequences/sh010/sh010_v001
